    bio: 'Anderson Silva is a Brazilian mixed martial artist who is considered the greatest mixed martial artist of all time by a number of MMA publications, as well as the UFC president Dana White. He is a former UFC Middleweight Champion who holds many UFC records, including the longest title streak with 16 straight wins and the most title defenses at 10. Coming from a poor family, he initially did not have the money to take fighting lessons, and supported himself in his early years working as a file clerk or at McDonald’s. He eventually joined Chute Boxe Academy and later earned his black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. He is also a professional boxer and has won one of his two professional fights via knockout. He has appeared in several films and in the Netflix reality show ‘Ultimate Beastmaster’. The documentary, ‘Like Water’, was based on his life. He is a fan of comic books and the superhero Spider-Man, from whom he got his nickname ‘The Spider’.',

    bio: 'Stipe Miocic is an American professional MMA fighter presently signed under the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). Born and brought up in Ohio, Stipe was always a curious kid interested in different kinds of sports he was exposed to. Coming from a middle class family, he didn’t receive any privileges of doing what he wanted to do in his life, and that’s why making a career in sports was a farfetched dream for him. Nevertheless, talent makes its own way and Stipe found himself competing in MMA in 2011 with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the biggest MMA platform. Starting his career with a local Ohio promotion, he won his first five fights cleanly with knockouts. Everything went well and he then went on to become the NAAFS World Heavyweight Champion. In his debut UFC game against his opponent Joey Beltran, he won via anonymous decision and this was just the beginning. Stipe went on to have a very successful career at UFC and received several honours such as ‘Performance of the Night’, ‘Fight of the Night’ and ‘Knockout of the Night’. He is currently the reigning ‘UFC Heavyweight Champion’ and ranked #4 in his weight category.',
