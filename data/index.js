    bio: 'Khabib Nurmagomedov is a retired Russian mixed martial artist, who competed in several forms like judo, wrestling, sambo, etc. He is best known for his longest unbeaten record of 29 wins in mixed martial arts (MMA). He fought in the lightweight division of the Ultimate Fight Championship (UFC) and was the longest-reigning UFC Lightweight Champion, having held the title from April 2018 to March 2021. Trained in martial arts from a young age, he developed an interest in the same seeing his father training his students. He was ranked as an International Master of Sports in Army Hand-to-Hand Combat, an International Master of Sports in Pankration, and a world champion in combat sambo. Khabib Nurmagomedov won several titles in numerous fields like mixed martial arts, sambo, grappling, and pankration. He is the most-followed Russian on Instagram, where he has 33 million followers. He also has more than 1.9 million followers on Twitter.',
    style:
      "Nurmagomedov employs a wrestling-based style of relentless pressure against his opponents, often described as 'mauling'. Using a variety of wrestling and judo/sambo takedowns, he forces his opponents against the cage, and ties up their legs and an arm to prevent them from escaping. From this position, he exhausts his opponents by forcing his weight against them and attacks with measured strikes his opponents are often unable to defend. This was one of his many signature styles that he used to deploy to advance towards his finishing move. Throughout his career, nineteen of his twenty-nine victories had come by way of either TKO/KO or submission.\n\n Former three-time UFC Heavyweight Champion and two-time UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture praised Nurmagomedov as “brilliant”. MMA Commentator Joe Rogan, a black belt in both 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, said of Nurmagomedov, “He’s the most terrifying lightweight contender in the world,” and “he’s just on such another level [of grappling] that the odds of beating him drop significantly after the first minute-and-a-half.” UFC referee Herb Dean stated Nurmagomedov constantly talks to his opponents during fights.",

When Cummins came in withan overhand right toward the end of the fight, DC just slipped it and counteredwith his own right. That shot ultimately was the beginning of the end forCummins.\n One of his earliest demonstrations of his punching power came againstAntonio Silva in September 2011, as he brought down Silva with a right handinside the opening minute of the fight.

    bio: 'Anderson Silva is a Brazilian mixed martial artist who is considered the greatest mixed martial artist of all time by a number of MMA publications, as well as the UFC president Dana White. He is a former UFC Middleweight Champion who holds many UFC records, including the longest title streak with 16 straight wins and the most title defenses at 10. Coming from a poor family, he initially did not have the money to take fighting lessons, and supported himself in his early years working as a file clerk or at McDonald’s. He eventually joined Chute Boxe Academy and later earned his black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. He is also a professional boxer and has won one of his two professional fights via knockout. He has appeared in several films and in the Netflix reality show ‘Ultimate Beastmaster’. The documentary, ‘Like Water’, was based on his life. He is a fan of comic books and the superhero Spider-Man, from whom he got his nickname ‘The Spider’.',
    style:
      "An expert in Muay Thai, boxing and taekwondo, Silva is primarily a stand-up fighter. Owner of numerous UFC offensive striking records, Silva is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the history of MMA and many consider him the best of all time. During his time in the UFC, he had a striking accuracy of 60%, attempting 1300 strikes and landing 779. A main attribute of Silva is his striking defense. In the UFC, he had a penchant for dodging opponent's strike attempts after taunting them and having his guard down. \n\n Silva's striking accuracy, knockout power, technically vicious Muay Thai and ability to counterstrike makes him a danger to his opponents. Silva's striking uses three major strengths: technical precision, the jab, and transitions and movement. Silva switches from southpaw to orthodox with little drop-off in effectiveness. Although it has been claimed that his ground game is not as good as his stand-up, Silva has submitted notable grapplers, including Olympic wrestler Dan Henderson, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu blackbelt Travis Lutter and Olympic alternate Chael Sonnen.",

    bio: 'Stipe Miocic is an American professional MMA fighter presently signed under the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship). Born and brought up in Ohio, Stipe was always a curious kid interested in different kinds of sports he was exposed to. Coming from a middle class family, he didn’t receive any privileges of doing what he wanted to do in his life, and that’s why making a career in sports was a farfetched dream for him. Nevertheless, talent makes its own way and Stipe found himself competing in MMA in 2011 with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the biggest MMA platform. Starting his career with a local Ohio promotion, he won his first five fights cleanly with knockouts. Everything went well and he then went on to become the NAAFS World Heavyweight Champion. In his debut UFC game against his opponent Joey Beltran, he won via anonymous decision and this was just the beginning. Stipe went on to have a very successful career at UFC and received several honours such as ‘Performance of the Night’, ‘Fight of the Night’ and ‘Knockout of the Night’. He is currently the reigning ‘UFC Heavyweight Champion’ and ranked #4 in his weight category.',
    style:
      'Stipe stays in his stance when pressuring. He knows when to break stance, feint and sidestep laterally when he’s being pressured. He possesses a powerful jab, a solid left hook (particularly to the body of Daniel Cormier), a booming right cross, and a pair of inside + outside leg kicks. When opponents attempt to close him down recklessly, he can dive on reactive singles, or draw responses from them and counterpunch. He’s a force from top position, implementing classic wrestling positions like the ride along the fence as well as a guard passing game with a mean brand of ground-and-pound. \n\n His technical game runs deeper than just the weapons he has or the strategy he selects to handle specific opponents. Miocic is a strong tactician. In their first fight, Junior dos Santos’ body jab entry and all of the combinations that came behind it befuddled Miocic. In the rematch, Stipe immediately starting countering the body jab with his thunderous right, and whenever his opponent inadvertently backed himself up to the fence, Stipe would sit down on his punches and light him up. In his most complete performances against Hunt and Ngannou, Miocic would blend feints, jabs, inside leg kicks, and level changes to turn both punchers completely passive. After drawing out the overextended responses, Stipe would pivot and counter them when their positioning was compromised.',

Starting his mixed martial arts career with the ‘Russian Top Team’, over the years he evolved as a champion in multiple sports including becoming heavyweight champion in MMA Pride Fighting Championships from 2003 to 2007 and also in FIAS World Combat Sambo Championship in 2002, 2005 and 2007. He also won two Bronze medals in Russian Judo Federation National Championship in 1998 and 1999. His enviable accomplishments earned him several awards and he is named as the all time greatest MMA Heavyweight fighter by ESPN, Fight Matrix and Sherdog among others. Broadly regarded as the master of ground-and-pound strategy, Emelianenko has remained the longest reigning Heavyweight lineal champion and the numero uno pound for pound fighter in the history of MMA. Following a retirement from the sports in 2012, he resumed back in 2015. Presently he serves as a deputy at Belgorod Regional Duma and a staff member of Russian Council on Physical Fitness & Sports.',
    style:
      "Sports Illustrated, among other publications, named Emelianenko as the top MMA fighter of the 2000s. Former combat sports fighters Chuck Norris and Mike Tyson; MMA fighters such as Junior dos Santos, Fabrício Werdum, Jose Aldo, and Georges St-Pierre; and several publications have called Emelianenko the greatest mixed martial artist of all time. MMA referee John McCarthy, sports commentator Michael Schiavello and others, have compared Emelianenko's impact and legacy in MMA to the likes of Muhammad Ali, Pelé, Wayne Gretzky, and their legacies in their respective sports. Sports and MMA media, ESPN, Bleacher Report, Sherdog, SB Nation (mmafighting) and Fight Matrix, list him as the greatest MMA heavyweight fighter of all time. Emelianenko is also the longest-reigning heavyweight lineal champion. As of 2021, Emelianenko has defeated seven former UFC champions. In 2020, UFC President Dana White stated that the only fight he regrets not having made was a match between Emelianenko and Brock Lesnar, when Lesnar was the UFC heavyweight champion. \n\n Although Emelianenko is mainly known as a striker, he is considered to excel in all of the attributes of the MMA game. MMA analyst Jack Slack wrote that, very few men can claim to have Olympic alternate level judo and still able to out-strike the best kickboxer in MMA history. Mixed martial arts champion and commentator Bas Rutten described Emelianenko's versatility as, if you give him an arm, he arm-bars you. If you give him a leg, he leg locks you. If you give him a punch, he knocks you out. \n\n In the stand-up, Emelianenko's aggressive boxing makes a wide usage of the Russian hook or casting punch popularised by Igor Vovchanchyn, as well as other types of more technical power punches to the body and head. This, combined with smart footwork, allows him to disrupt the offence of more scientific strikers and land strikes. He frequently darts into striking range with either a left hook or an overhand right to disrupt counterpunches, resulting in a flurry of punches that often stun or flatten his opponents.",

After Ali died in June 2016, McGregor opined that nobody will ever come close to [Ali's] greatness. McGregor has also cited Bruce Lee as an inspiration, and compared himself to Lee. During the buildup to his bout against Donald Cerrone and the rematch against Dustin Poirier, McGregor was respectful towards his opponents and refrained from trash talking.

He is noted for his ability to land fast punches and kicks to the head or body, then quickly escape an opponent's reach. He is also known for his ability to counterstrike while standing within the pocket. During upperbody clinches, Johnson has also utilized the Muay Thai plum while mixing in a series of elbows and knees. To complement his traditional wrestling base Johnson is also schooled in Catch wrestling under his long-term coach Matt Hume, as evident by his Catch style direct suplex-to-armlock transition against Ray Borg, and his Double wrist lock submission (aka Kimura) of Chris Cariaso.",

    bio: "Jerome Max Holloway (born December 4, 1991) is an American professional mixed martial artist. He currently competes in the Featherweight division in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). A professional since 2010, Holloway became the UFC Featherweight Champion when he defeated José Aldo on June 3, 2017, before defending the title three times. As of March 29, 2021, he is #1 in UFC featherweight rankings and as of July 11, 2022 he is #10 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.",
    style:
      'Overall, it’s very clear that Max Holloway is primarily a boxer. However, to label him as just a boxer is also doing him a massive injustice. As seen, he can also strike using Muay Thai techniques, whilst his grappling is covered by a combination of BJJ and wrestling. With both striking and grappling covered, it’s no surprise that Holloway is such a skilled martial artist as he doesn’t really have any flaws in his game. \n\n With this said, it’s fair to say that Holloway is a true definition of a mixed martial artist. What’s more, is that it also shows a good mindset when someone actively trains the lesser parts of their game such as wrestling and Muay Thai to help improve their overall skill level. In conclusion, Max Holloway’s fighting style combines devastating boxing with Muay Thai kicks, defensive wrestling, and BJJ which is what makes him one of the best fighters on the planet.',

    bio: 'Georges “Rush” St-Pierre is a Canadian mixed martial artist, actor, and former UFC champion in two weight classes. Often referred to as GSP, he is commonly regarded as one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time. A native of Quebec, St-Pierre had a troubled childhood and started taking Kyokushin Karate lessons when he was seven years old. By the time he turned 16, he was learning wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and boxing. St-Pierre began his professional career in January 2002 at the Ultimate Combat Championship in a match against Ivan Menjivar. He won the bout and went on to fight in UCC for another three matches before making his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut at UFC 46 against Karo Parisyan, a match that he also won. In the ensuing years, he won UFC Welterweight Championship three times and UFC Middleweight Championship one time and was listed as the Canadian Athlete of the Year by Rogers Sportsnet for 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2013, St-Pierre vacated his Welterweight title and went on a four-year-long hiatus from the sport. He eventually returned in November 2017 to defeat Michael Bisping for the middleweight belt. However, he had to vacate soon after due to health issues.',
    style:
      'As former UFC welterweight champion George St. Pierre stepped away from fighting in November 2013, he took his efficient, point-based fighting style with him. This was St. Pierre’s choosing, however; UFC brass has been handing out walking papers for years now. \n\n Dana White has never held back his thoughts, and has publicly criticized the fight world’s less entertaining names. White has been quick to judge those like Jon Fitch and Ben Askren, who are traditional wrestlers. Fitch, prior to his release, went 1-2-1 in the organization, spearheading White’s arguments. White’s comments are ill-advised though; the UFC still needs guys like Fitch.',

    bio: 'Jonathan Dwight Jones is a mixed martial artist from America who has won the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship twice. Generally considered to be one of the greatest mixed martial artists of all time, he has also become somewhat of a tragic figure and his life story, a cautionary tale. Raised in a middle-class family in New York, Jones’ life has been deeply influenced by religion since his childhood. He demonstrated prodigious skills as a wrestler in his school days and won the state championship at Union-Endicott High School in upstate New York. He was also involved in football as a defensive lineman. Initially, Jones was pursuing a degree in criminal justice but then his MMA career really took off and he dropped out of college to be a professional fighter. He made his professional debut in April 2008 against Brad Bernard, a match he won by a technical knockout. In a career spanning nearly a decade, Jones has won most of his matches and his only defeat came about because of a dubious decision made by the referee. He has won the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship twice only to be stripped of his title both the times. The first time he was stripped because of a hit-and-run case in 2015. He also lost the interim title because of a doping violation. Recently, in 2017, he was stripped after a positive drug test. The investigation is currently ongoing and if Jones is found guilty, he could find himself serving a four-year ban.',
    style:
      "Jones stands out by his high adaptability and flawless technique in the cage and has been described as one of the most dynamic, innovative, and constantly evolving fighters in the history of MMA and perhaps the greatest martial artist ever to step into an octagon. Jones capitalizes on his great range and defensive wrestling to land blows in a creative, unorthodox style. \n\n He employs a diverse kicking technique, favoring front kicks to the body and head, roundhouse kicks to the legs and upper body, and his most known technique, the oblique kick, a controversial move that targets his opponent's knee. The oblique kick was a technique popularized by Bruce Lee, who Jones cited as an inspiration. Jones also excels in the clinch, where he is skilled at controlling his opponent's arms and scoring elbow and knee strikes. On the ground, he has excellent positional control and an ability to find openings for punches and elbow strikes.",
