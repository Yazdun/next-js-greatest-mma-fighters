He eventually joined Chute Boxe Academy and later earned his black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu from Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira. He is also a professional boxer and has won one of his two professional fights via knockout. He has appeared in several films and in the Netflix reality show ‘Ultimate Beastmaster’.

Nevertheless, talent makes its own way and Stipe found himself competing in MMA in 2011 with the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the biggest MMA platform. Starting his career with a local Ohio promotion, he won his first five fights cleanly with knockouts. Everything went well and he then went on to become the NAAFS World Heavyweight Champion. In his debut UFC game against his opponent Joey Beltran, he won via anonymous decision and this was just the beginning. Stipe went on to have a very successful career at UFC and received several honours such as ‘Performance of the Night’, ‘Fight of the Night’ and ‘Knockout of the Night’.

He demonstrated prodigious skills as a wrestler in his school days and won the state championship at Union-Endicott High School in upstate New York. He was also involved in football as a defensive lineman. Initially, Jones was pursuing a degree in criminal justice but then his MMA career really took off and he dropped out of college to be a professional fighter. He made his professional debut in April 2008 against Brad Bernard, a match he won by a technical knockout. In a career spanning nearly a decade, Jones has won most of his matches and his only defeat came about because of a dubious decision made by the referee. He has won the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship twice only to be stripped of his title both the times. The first time he was stripped because of a hit-and-run case in 2015. He also lost the interim title because of a doping violation. Recently, in 2017, he was stripped after a positive drug test. The investigation is currently ongoing and if Jones is found guilty, he could find himself serving a four-year ban.',
